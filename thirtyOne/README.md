# Game 31 (May 2015)
This is a simple 2 player game my grandfather taught me when I was a kid (I'm using his version instead of other versions available online).

It starts with one of the players saying one number between 1 and 3 (inclusive). Then, each player adds to the previous value 1, 2 or 3. The player who says 31 wins the game.

#### Backstory
When I was 15, I saw a friend of mine writing bat files. I thought it was really hacky and cool, so I had to learn how to do that! After taking and reading some tutorials online, I came up with a really naive approach to batch scripting, that allowed me to make this horrendous code (opinion from 06/2019). Time Machine Rule applied here, but maybe in the future I'll make a decent and playable version of this game!
