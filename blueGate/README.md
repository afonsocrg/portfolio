# Blue Gate (October 2020 - January 2021)

This project was developed along [@Ekhao](https://github.com/Ekhao) and [Farzad](https://github.com/farzadtehranian) in the scope of the course of Network and Computer Security.

We developed a seamless and secure authentication system that leveraged bluetooth and fingerprint recognition technologies to make this process seamless to the user.
The project [report](project_report.pdf) presents a more detailed analysis of this solution.
