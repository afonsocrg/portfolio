# Computer Graphics in Three.js (October - November 2019)

During the course of Computer Graphics, me, [Daniel](https://github.com/Beu-Wolf) and [Marcelo](https://github.com/tosmarcel) were challenged to build several graphical interactive scenes, with increasing complexity.

We learned how to work with `Three.js` and how to use cameras, lights, textures and physics. In each subdirectory you will find a more detailed description of the respective challenge.
