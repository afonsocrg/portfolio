# MasterMind (October - November 2017)
In this project, me and [Daniel Seara](https://github.com/Beu-Wolf) developed a MasterMind [(rules here)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) game interface in assembly for [P3](http://web.ist.utl.pt/~ist14359/sw/p3vm/), a processor developed by [Arlindo Oliveira](http://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/arlindo.oliveira/) & Co.

We implemented a random code generator and also a countdown timer (just to spice things up), aaand because we were asked to...

The game is played in a virtual simulator of the 16 bit processor (p3sim) and compiled using p3as (both in P3 folder).

In this repo you will find the project itself in the projectFiles folder (the source code (.as), one reference file (.lis) and the application itself), the p3as compiler, the p3sim simulator and two Portuguese p3sim guides made by the authors of the P3.
