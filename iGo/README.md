# iGo (March - May 2019)

Within the scope of Human-Computer Interaction, our team ([Daniel](https://github.com/Beu-Wolf), [Marcelo](https://github.com/tosmarcel) and me) was asked to develop a wearable device that would be useful for travellers. After some market research (we managed to have 50 answers to our questionnaire), we concluded that emergency, translation and GPS functionalities were the top 3 most needed by our target market.
All the development of this device was planned (we made some prototypes and storyboards) and iteratively done. At the end of the first stage, we were able to test our interface with 26 users, who gave us good feedback about our interface. We came up with a list of improvements to be done. Unfortunately, the semester is over, so maybe one day they will be implemented.

##### [DISCLAIMER]
Our prototype was developed using Firefox, so the team is not responsible for any malfunction that takes place in other browsers. There are still some tweaks to be made, but we'll leave them as they are now. Hope you have fun playing with it!
