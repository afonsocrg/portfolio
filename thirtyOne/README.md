# 31 Game (May 2015)
This is a simple 2 player game my grandfather taught me when I was a kid (I'm using his version instead of other versions available online).

It starts with one of the players saying one number between 1 and 3 (inclusive). Then, each player adds to the previous value 1, 2 or 3. The player who says 31 wins the game.

Unfortunately, the single player version is broken... You can still get the idea ;) (Time Machine Rule applied here. Maybe in the future, I'll make a decent and playable version of this game!)

## Backstory
When I was 15, I saw a friend of mine writing bat files. I thought it was really badass, so I wanted to learn how to do that! After reading some tutorials online, I came up with a really basic approach to batch scripting that allowed me to make this ~~horrendous~~ magnificent code (opinion from 06/2019). I was a true script kiddie back then!

This was my first contact to scripting and programming commands. It made me really fascinated about informatics and computers! Guess what? Ended up studying Computer Science...
