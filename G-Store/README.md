# Distributed Storage (September - December 2020)

This project was developed in the scope of the Design and Implementation of Distributed Applications.
We were proposed to develop a distributed storage application, with fault tolerant mechanisms.

This project was developed alongside [Daniel Seara](https://github.com/Beu-Wolf/) and [Marcelo Santos](https://github.com/tosmarcel).
