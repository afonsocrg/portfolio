# Translate Right (October-December 2019)
This project consisted of making a database system that allowed people to identify writing errors in public spaces. 

The problem was first modelled in an EA notation. Then we proceeded to actually build the tables and populating it. In the final stage, we built a web interface that allowed the database administrators to securely interact with it.
