# Ball Algorithm (February - May 2021)

This project consisted of parallelizing a given algorithm, that calculated a Ball-Tree data structure.

In a first stage, the parallelization relied on different threads in the same CPU (we used OpenMP). In the second stage, we used MPI to take advantage of the computational power of a computer cluster.

Results and detailed information about the implementation can be found in our [report](report.pdf).
