# afonsocrg Portfolio (May 2015 - ???)

Hello, dear visitor! Welcome to my portfolio!

Here I will keep track of every project I have already made. This portfolio will follow my "Time Machine Rule": Every single project will be kept as it was when it was finished. This way I'll be able to check my progress and evolution throughout the years.

I'm trying to keep these projects readable to most of you, therefore I'm doing my best to keep everything in English. However, some projects/reports had to be made/written in Portuguese and translating them would break the Time Machine Rule (It would also be really time consuming).
