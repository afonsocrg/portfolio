# Word Guru (October - November 2017)

Word Guru is a word multiplayer challenge, in which the players have to create several (in this project, portuguese) words, according to some given letters and a BNF portuguese grammar (the grammar is not that perfect, okay?).

The player can only use the displayed letters. The score increases with the length of the word played. If you type an incorrect word, you lose some points.
Initially, the players "signs up" in the game, giving their nickname and start playing immediatly.
The game ends when every valid word is found.
